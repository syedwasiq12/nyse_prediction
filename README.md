This project focuses on developing an advanced predictive model using GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) architecture to forecast the closing prices of selected stocks such as YAHOO. By merging historical stock data sourced from Yahoo Finance with fundamental metrics extracted from Nasdaq Financials and EDGAR SEC databases, the model achieves robust predictive capabilities. The integration of technical analysis from historical data and fundamental metrics enhances the accuracy of price forecasts, offering insights into market behavior and trends. The GRU architecture plays a crucial role in capturing temporal dependencies within the stock data, effectively addressing challenges like the vanishing gradient problem and improving the model's ability to retain long-term dependencies. This approach not only enhances prediction accuracy but also provides a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics, making it valuable for financial forecasting and decision-making.
